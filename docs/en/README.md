## Launch

After downloading, extract the files to any directory.

::: warning
But please do not put the software in special paths such as **C:\Program Files**, otherwise, even with administrator privileges, you may not be able to save configuration and cache files, or even run the program.
:::

- **LunaTranslator.exe** will start in normal mode.

- **LunaTranslator_admin.exe** will start with administrator privileges, which is required for hooking some games; use this only when necessary, otherwise start in normal mode.

- **LunaTranslator_debug.bat** will display a command-line window.

## Update

Updates are performed automatically by default. If automatic update fails, you can update manually.

To update manually, simply download the new version and extract it to overwrite the previous directory.

If you want to delete and re-download, be careful not to delete the userconfig folder, otherwise you will lose your previous settings!!!

### Missing Important Components

Solution: Close antivirus software. If it cannot be closed (such as Windows Defender), add it to the trust list and then re-download.

Note: To achieve HOOK extraction of game text, it is necessary to inject Dll into the game. Files such as shareddllproxy32.exe/LunaHost32.dll implement this, and therefore are particularly likely to be considered as viruses. The software is currently automatically built by [Github Actions](https://github.com/HIllya51/LunaTranslator/actions). Unless the Github server is infected, it is impossible to contain viruses, so it can be safely added to the trust list.

::: details For Windows Defender, the method is: “Virus & threat protection” -> “Exclusions” -> “Add or remove exclusions” -> “Add an exclusion” -> “Folder”, add Luna's folder to it

### Error/FileNotFoundError

If trust isn't pre-established, some essential components might get deleted by antivirus software after the program has been running for a while. Then when selecting a process in HOOK mode, this error occurs. The solution is the same as above.

### Error/PermissionError

If the software is placed in special folders such as `C:\Program Files`, it may not work properly.
