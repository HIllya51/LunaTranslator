> These are universal buttons that appear in clipboard mode. From left to right:



&emsp;&emsp;**Retranslate**: By default, LunaTranslator doesn't translate very short texts. Use this button to force translation. It's also useful when translators occasionally malfunction or return errors

&emsp;&emsp;**Auto Translate**: Automatically translates received text. The button is pink when enabled and white when paused

&emsp;&emsp;**Open Settings**: Opens the settings window.


&emsp;&emsp;**Copy to Clipboard**: Copies the latest text extracted by OCR/HOOK to the clipboard

&emsp;&emsp;**Show/Hide Original Text**: Toggles the display of the original text

&emsp;&emsp;**Show Translation History**: Opens a window displaying previously extracted original text and translations

&emsp;&emsp;**Text-to-Speech**: When enabled, reads aloud the latest text from clipboard/OCR/HOOK. Note: This requires a Japanese text-to-speech engine installed on your system

&emsp;&emsp;**Mouse Click-through**: Makes the translation window fully transparent. Clicks will pass through to the game window beneath


&emsp;&emsp;**Lock Toolbar**: Disable toolbar auto-hide. The button is pink when active and white when disabled

&emsp;&emsp;**Game Manager**: Opens the game list window to select and open a game

&emsp;&emsp;**Minimize to Tray**: Hides LunaTranslator to the system tray. You can restore LunaTranslator from the tray icon

&emsp;&emsp;**Exit**: Closes the software


## OCR Mode Buttons

> OCR mode includes three additional buttons:

&emsp;&emsp;**Select OCR Region**: Allows you to select the area for OCR (similar to screenshot tools)

&emsp;&emsp;**Show/Hide Region Border**: Toggles the visibility of the rectangle indicating the OCR recognition area.

&emsp;&emsp;**Bind to Window**: Click this button, then click on the game window. The button turns pink to indicate successful binding. This allows the translation window to overlap the OCR region. Click the button and then click on the translator itself to unbind.


## HOOK Mode Buttons
