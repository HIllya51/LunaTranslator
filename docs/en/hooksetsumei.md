There are three ways to select a process:

- Click "Click me, then click the game window" and then click on the game window. This will automatically detect the game process.
- Choose the game from the list below.
- Manually enter the process ID.

Note: When running in no_admin mode, the process may be displayed or selections may do nothing. Please switch to admin mode to fix this.

After selection, click OK. A text selection window will automatically appear. (You can also open this by clicking "Select Text" or the second highlighted button in the toolbar)

Once the text selection window is open, click on the game to display the next line of text. This will show several extracted text strings.

If there are many items in the list, you can filter them by entering text from the current game window into the "Search Entries Containing Text" box at the bottom.

For example, by searching for the Japanese word "約束" (yakusoku) that appears in the game, you'll filter the list down to just one item.

To select multiple items, hold down the Ctrl key while clicking.

After making your selection(s), click OK to start the translation. If you later find that the selected items are not suitable, you can always make a new selection.
