#### Step 4: Obtain AK/SK

Before calling various capabilities of the Volcano Engine Visual Intelligence Console, ensure that you have generated an access key (AccessKey).

To obtain: Click the account in the upper right corner, select [Key Management] from the drop-down list, and click the [Create New Key] button to get the AK/SK, which can be used as credentials to call interfaces of the applications you have integrated.

== Xunfei

### Step 1: Register as a Developer

Enter the [Xunfei Open Platform Quick Login Page](https://passport.xfyun.cn/login), log in via WeChat scan code or mobile quick login to quickly become a registered developer on the Xunfei Open Platform. Or go to the [Xunfei Open Platform Registration Page](https://passport.xfyun.cn/register) to register a complete open platform account and become a registered developer on the Xunfei Open Platform.

### Step 2: Create Your First Application and Start Using Services

Log in to the platform and go to the console through the "Console" in the upper right corner, or the "My Applications" in the drop-down menu in the upper right corner. If your account has never created an application, we will guide you to create your first application.

[](https://www.xfyun.cn/doc/assets/img/creatapp.7d53afaa.png)

Name your application and fill in the relevant information. After clicking the submit button, your application will be created.

> [!WARNING]
>In the old version of the console, you needed to specify the operating system platform type of the application for subsequent SDK or API integration. However, after the update to the new version, this operation is no longer required, and all interfaces can be managed through one application.

After the application is created, you can choose the service you want to use through the service list on the left. In the service management panel, you will see the available quota, historical usage, verification information for the service interface, and the APIs and SDKs that can be called.

[](https://www.xfyun.cn/doc/assets/img/manage1.469e7fa3.png)

[](https://www.xfyun.cn/doc/assets/img/manage2.cc025e41.png)


> [!WARNING]
>Not every service management panel is the same. Different services have different compositions of their management panels. Also, not all services have both SDK and API interfaces; some services only have API interfaces, while others only have SDKs. Specifics can be found on the corresponding service management page.


The Xunfei Open Platform supports creating multiple applications with one account. To return to the application list page and switch applications, click the return button above the application name in the upper left corner of the page, or the "My Applications" in the personal menu in the top right. In the application list, select an application and click its name to enter the service management page corresponding to that application.

The same application APPID can be used across multiple businesses without restriction, but since multiple businesses sharing one APPID cannot track usage separately, it is recommended to use a separate application APPID for each business.

[](https://www.xfyun.cn/doc/assets/img/BACK.75999ee8.png)

> [!WARNING]
>If your account has multiple applications, the last application you operated will be recorded and set as the default application when you return to the Xunfei Open Platform for various service operations.

### How to Install Additional Language Support for WindowsOCR?

>[!WARNING]
> WindowsOCR only supports Windows 10 and Windows 11 operating systems.

#### How to query for OCR language packs

To return the list of all supported language packs, open PowerShell as an Administrator (right-click, then select "Run as Administrator") and enter the following command:

```
Get-WindowsCapability -Online | Where-Object { $_.Name -Like 'Language.OCR*' }
```

An example output:

```
Name  : Language.OCR~~~el-GR~0.0.1.0
State : NotPresent

Name  : Language.OCR~~~en-GB~0.0.1.0
State : NotPresent

Name  : Language.OCR~~~en-US~0.0.1.0
State : Installed

Name  : Language.OCR~~~es-ES~0.0.1.0
State : NotPresent

Name  : Language.OCR~~~es-MX~0.0.1.0
State : NotPresent
```

The language and location is abbreviated, so "en-US" would be "English-United States" and "en-GB" would be "English-Great Britain". If a language is not available in the output, then it's not supported by OCR. `State: NotPresent` languages must be installed first.

#### How to install an OCR language pack

The following commands install the OCR pack for "en-US":

```
$Capability = Get-WindowsCapability -Online | Where-Object { $_.Name -Like 'Language.OCR*en-US*' }`
$Capability | Add-WindowsCapability -Online
```

#### How to remove an OCR language pack

The following commands remove the OCR pack for "en-US":

```
$Capability = Get-WindowsCapability -Online | Where-Object { $_.Name -Like 'Language.OCR*en-US*' }
$Capability | Remove-WindowsCapability -Online
```
