== DeepL/DeepLX

There are two types: `DeepL` and `DeepLX`.

`DeepL` is a built-in reverse interface that can be used directly, but it is prone to risk control.

`DeepLX` requires downloading and deploying [DeepLX](https://github.com/OwO-Network/DeepLX) yourself, and entering the `DeepLX api` to use.

== Lingva

The default host is `translate.plausibility.cloud`, or you can deploy [Lingva Translate](https://github.com/thedaviddelta/lingva-translate) yourself and enter your own domain.
