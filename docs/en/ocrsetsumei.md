The second button toggles the visibility of the selection region.

The third button allows you to bind the screenshot to a specific window. To do this:
1. Click the button
2. Click on the game window
3. The button will turn pink, indicating a successful bind

To unbind, click the button and then click on the translator itself.

Here's how it looks when bound to a screenshot window. OCR will function normally even if windows overlap:
